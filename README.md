Video game in C++ using the raylib library for Programming in C/C++ class


I used the raylib library for the final product and separated my objects into classes inline with object-oriented programming. I implemented a paddle to move based on user input (arrow keys). The ball stays within the window, but the player will lose a life if it collides with the bottom of the screen. These lives are shown in the top-left corner and will count down from three. I added a timer to the top middle of the screen as a way for the player to keep track of progress. When it came to the ball-block collision, I knew that the position that was encoded for the block was only the top-left corner. So when I built the collision function, I had to add in all the edges that the ball would hit. I did this by asking if the ball position was greater than the block position, but smaller than the block position plus the block size. I also wanted to have the ball change angles based on where the ball hit the paddle, so I would change the ball speed more drastically as the ball got towards the outer edges of the paddle. Furthermore, I needed to retrieve the individual block positions in a class that would make it difficult to access them. My solution was to put pointers to the blocks in a vector, so I could get each of their positions in whichever file I needed to.
